üöÄ **Features**
Automated deployment of Kubernetes clusters using GitHub Actions
Infrastructure provisioning using shell scripts
Multi-node cluster setup
Modular and reusable workflow components

üõ†Ô∏è **Prerequisites**
GitHub account with repository access
GitHub Actions enabled
Virtual machines or cloud instances (Ubuntu recommended)
SSH access to all nodes
Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and shell scripting

‚öôÔ∏è **Setup Instructions**
